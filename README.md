# Work makes you happy to some extent, if two much could penalize you happiness score

Fitting different lineal, quadratic and cubic models, and more degrees in R.

So the lineal model explaining happyness on the basis on working hr is:
```
    happiness= 44.83 - 0.13hours
```
and the cuadratic model explaining happyness on the basis on working hr is:
```
happiness = 30.88 + 0.52hours - 0.0038hours^2
```
and so on for the others
